## Getting Started

基本的にはDockerでセットアップする。

## Running Server
If you have Docker installed, you can start up the server by running the make command.

```
$ make build
$ make init
$ make article-migrate in ../migration
$ make seed
$ make server
```

## Testing
The tests are ready to run via Docker as well.

```
$ make test
```
